# Indoor Location Tracking Using WiFi Fingerprinting

This project aims to solve the problem of indoor localization, which has garnered increased attention due to the loss of GPS signal in indoor environments. We use WiFi fingerprinting, an approach where the location and base station ID (BSSID) of each WiFi access point (AP) in a building is recorded as part of a survey. An asset tag then scans the WiFi environment and reports the list of WiFi APs and their associated signal strengths. For Storing acquired result Sqlite databse desgined and used.
